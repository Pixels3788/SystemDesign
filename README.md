# System Design

The client for this project was DriverPass, DriverPass wanted a system that would allow them to-
signup customers, let the customers or DriverPasses secretaries schedule driving lessons for customers,-
and allow customers to do online courses for driving and learning the rules of the road

I feel like I did particularly well with gathering the business requirements and making the business requirements document.
I went through the transcript for the interview that was done with the owner and IT officer of DriverPass and used that-
among other resources to figure out all of the requirements.

The part of my work I would revise is specifically my sequence diagram. I would improve it by spending more time and effort to-
make it more thorough and better show the sequence. That was the diagram I struggled the most with making, and I wish I had spent-
more time on it to make it better.

I interpreted the users needs by trying to put myself in the mind of the user. That way I could see things from a users perspective-
and figure out what would work for the user. It is always important to consider user's needs when designing because you have to make-
a product that solves a problem in a way that benefits the user and makes it easier for them to use.

I approach software design with an open mind, and try to visualize things through multiple perspectives to try to figure out the-
best route to take.
